# **Difference Between `Synchronized HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap`**

Both `Synchronized HashMap` and `ConcurrentHashMap` are thread-safe versions of `HashMap`, but they differ significantly in **performance, locking mechanisms, and scalability**. Below is a detailed comparison:

---

## **1. Synchronized HashMap**
### **How It Works**
- **Uses a single global lock** (on the entire map) for all operations (`get`, `put`, `remove`).
- Achieves thread safety via `Collections.synchronizedMap()`:
  ```java
  Map<K, V> syncMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());
  ```

### **Key Characteristics**
‚úÖ **Thread-safe** (only one thread can access the map at a time).  
‚ùå **Poor performance** under high concurrency (due to **full locking**).  
‚ùå **Not scalable** (all threads compete for the same lock).  
‚ùå **Deadlock risk** if used improperly in nested calls.  

### **When to Use?**
- Only when **thread safety is needed but concurrency is low**.
- **Legacy code** where `ConcurrentHashMap` is not available.

---

## **2. ConcurrentHashMap**
### **How It Works**
- Introduced in Java 5 (`java.util.concurrent` package).
- Uses **fine-grained locking** (lock striping) or **CAS (Compare-And-Swap) operations** (Java 8+).
- Divides the map into **segments (Java 7)** or **buckets (Java 8+)** and applies locks only where needed.

### **Key Characteristics**
‚úÖ **Thread-safe with high concurrency** (multiple threads can read/write simultaneously).  
‚úÖ **Better performance** (no global lock, allows concurrent reads and limited writes).  
‚úÖ **Scalable** (locks only on bucket-level in Java 8+).  
‚úÖ **No deadlocks** (no lock-ordering issues).  
‚úÖ **Supports atomic operations** (`putIfAbsent`, `compute`, `merge`).  

### **When to Use?**
- **High-concurrency applications** (e.g., web servers, caching systems).
- **Multi-threaded environments** where performance matters.

## **3. Key Differences**

| Feature | `Synchronized HashMap` | `ConcurrentHashMap` |
|---------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Locking Mechanism** | Single global lock | Segment/bucket-level locking (Java 7), CAS (Java 8+) |
| **Thread Safety** | Yes (but high contention) | Yes (low contention) |
| **Performance** | Slow (serialized access) | Faster (parallel reads, limited parallel writes) |
| **Scalability** | Poor (all threads block) | High (multiple threads can work simultaneously) |
| **Null Keys/Values** | Allowed | **Not allowed** (throws `NullPointerException`) |
| **Iterator Behavior** | **Fail-fast** (throws `ConcurrentModificationException`) | **Weakly consistent** (does not throw CME) |
| **Java Version** | Since Java 1.2 | Since Java 5 (improved in Java 8) |
| **Best For** | Low-concurrency scenarios | High-concurrency applications |

---

## **4. Performance Comparison**
| Operation | `Synchronized HashMap` | `ConcurrentHashMap` |
|-----------|-----------------------|----------------------|
| **Read (`get`)** | Blocks all other threads | Non-blocking (reads can happen in parallel) |
| **Write (`put`)** | Blocks entire map | Locks only a segment/bucket |
| **Iteration** | Needs external synchronization | Safe without locking (weakly consistent) |

---

## **5. Example Code**
### **Synchronized HashMap**
```java
Map<String, Integer> syncMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());

// Thread-safe but slow under contention
syncMap.put("A", 1);
int value = syncMap.get("A");
```

### **ConcurrentHashMap**
```java
ConcurrentMap<String, Integer> concurrentMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();

// Thread-safe & faster in multi-threaded apps
concurrentMap.put("B", 2);
int val = concurrentMap.get("B");

// Atomic operations (no manual synchronization needed)
concurrentMap.putIfAbsent("C", 3);
concurrentMap.compute("C", (k, v) -> v + 10);
```

---

## **6. Java 8+ Improvements in `ConcurrentHashMap`**
1. **Replaced Segment Locks with CAS (Compare-And-Swap)**  
   - Uses `synchronized` only on **contended buckets** (reduces lock overhead).
2. **Enhanced Parallelism**  
   - Introduced `forEach`, `reduce`, `search` (supports bulk operations).
3. **Treeified Buckets**  
   - Like `HashMap`, converts long collision chains into **Red-Black Trees** (O(log n) worst-case).

---

## **7. Which One Should You Use?**
| Scenario | Recommended Choice |
|----------|-------------------|
| **Low concurrency, simple thread safety** | `Synchronized HashMap` |
| **High concurrency, performance-critical** | `ConcurrentHashMap` |
| **Read-heavy workloads** | `ConcurrentHashMap` |
| **Atomic operations needed** | `ConcurrentHashMap` |

---

## **Conclusion**
- **`Synchronized HashMap`** ‚Üí Simple but slow (global lock).  
- **`ConcurrentHashMap`** ‚Üí High-performance, scalable (fine-grained locking/CAS).  

For **modern multi-threaded applications**, `ConcurrentHashMap` is almost always the better choice due to its **efficiency and scalability**. üöÄ
