### **When to Use Which?**
- ‚úÖ **Use `HashMap`** when working in a **single-threaded** environment (best performance).
- ‚úÖ **Use `ConcurrentHashMap`** in **multi-threaded** applications where multiple threads need to read/write concurrently.
- ‚úÖ **Use `SynchronizedMap`** if you need a thread-safe map but can afford lower performance due to full-map locking.

Understanding the differences between `HashMap`, `ConcurrentHashMap`, and `synchronized HashMap` is crucial for working with maps in multithreaded Java environments. Here's a breakdown:

**1. HashMap:**

* **Not Thread-Safe:**
    * A standard `HashMap` is not designed for concurrent access. If multiple threads try to modify it simultaneously, it can lead to data corruption and `ConcurrentModificationException` errors.
* **Performance:**
    * In single-threaded environments, `HashMap` offers excellent performance due to its efficient hashing mechanism.
* **Null Handling:**
    * Allows one `null` key and multiple `null` values.

**2. synchronized HashMap:**

* **Thread-Safe (Basic):**
    * You create a synchronized `HashMap` using `Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap())`. This wraps the `HashMap` with synchronization, ensuring that only one thread can access it at a time.
* **Performance:**
    * This approach provides thread safety, but it can lead to performance bottlenecks in highly concurrent scenarios. Because the whole map is locked on every operation.
* **Null Handling:**
    * Null handling is the same as the underlying HashMap, therefore it allows one null key and multiple null values.
* **How it works:**
    * This is achieved by synchronizing every method of the map.

**3. ConcurrentHashMap:**

* **Thread-Safe (High Concurrency):**
    * `ConcurrentHashMap` is specifically designed for high-concurrency applications. It achieves thread safety through more fine-grained locking.
    * It divides the map into segments (or buckets) and only locks the specific segment being accessed, allowing multiple threads to read and write concurrently.
* **Performance:**
    * Offers significantly better performance than a synchronized `HashMap` in concurrent environments.
* **Null Handling:**
    * Does not allow `null` keys or `null` values.
* **How it works:**
    * It uses segment locking to allow multiple threads to access different parts of the map concurrently.

**Key Differences Summarized:**

* **Thread Safety:**
    * `HashMap`: Not thread-safe.
    * `synchronized HashMap`: Thread-safe (basic, whole-map locking).
    * `ConcurrentHashMap`: Thread-safe (high concurrency, segment locking).
* **Performance:**
    * `HashMap`: Best in single-threaded environments.
    * `synchronized HashMap`: Lower performance in high-concurrency.
    * `ConcurrentHashMap`: Highest performance in high-concurrency.
* **Null Handling:**
    * `HashMap`: Allows one `null` key, multiple `null` values.
    * `synchronized HashMap`: Allows one `null` key, multiple `null` values.
    * `ConcurrentHashMap`: Does not allow `null` keys or values.

**When to Use:**

* Use `HashMap` when thread safety is not a concern.
* Use `synchronized HashMap` when you need basic thread safety and performance is not critical, or when working with legacy code.
* Use `ConcurrentHashMap` when you need high concurrency and optimal performance in multithreaded applications.

### **1. `HashMap` (Non-Thread-Safe)**
- **No synchronization**, hence **not thread-safe**.
- **Fastest** but can cause `ConcurrentModificationException` if modified while iterating.
- **Allows `null` keys and values**.
- **Use Case**: Single-threaded applications where performance is critical.

### **2. `Synchronized HashMap` (`Collections.synchronizedMap`)**
- Wraps `HashMap` with **synchronized methods**, making it thread-safe.
- **Global lock**: Only one thread can access the entire map at a time ‚Üí **High contention**.
- **Performance impact** due to blocking.
- **Use Case**: Legacy code needing thread safety, but not optimal for high concurrency.

### **3. `ConcurrentHashMap` (Best for High Concurrency)**
- **Thread-safe** with **fine-grained locking** (locks only segments or uses CAS).
- **Higher throughput** as multiple threads can read/write simultaneously.
- **No `null` keys/values** allowed (to avoid ambiguity in concurrent operations).
- **Weakly consistent iterators** (won‚Äôt throw `ConcurrentModificationException`).
- **Use Case**: Multi-threaded environments (e.g., caching, concurrent data processing).

---

### **When to Use Which?**
- **Use `HashMap`** ‚Üí Single-threaded apps.
- **Use `Synchronized HashMap`** ‚Üí Low-concurrency legacy code (not recommended for new code).
- **Use `ConcurrentHashMap`** ‚Üí High-concurrency apps (best for modern Java).

### **Example:**
```java
// HashMap (Not thread-safe)
Map<String, Integer> hashMap = new HashMap<>();

// Synchronized HashMap (Thread-safe but slow)
Map<String, Integer> syncMap = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap<>());

// ConcurrentHashMap (Thread-safe & optimized)
Map<String, Integer> concurrentMap = new ConcurrentHashMap<>();
```

### **Summary**
- **`ConcurrentHashMap`** is the **best choice** for concurrent applications.
- **`Synchronized HashMap`** is **obsolete** for new code (due to poor performance).
- **`HashMap`** is **only for single-threaded** use.
