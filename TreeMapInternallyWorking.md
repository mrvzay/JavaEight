# **Internal Working of `TreeMap` in Java**

`TreeMap` in Java is a **Red-Black Tree (RBT)-based** implementation of the `NavigableMap` interface. Unlike `HashMap` (which uses a hash table) or `LinkedHashMap` (which combines a hash table with a linked list), `TreeMap` stores entries in a **sorted tree structure**, ensuring **O(log n)** time complexity for `put()`, `get()`, and `remove()` operations.

---

## **1. Red-Black Tree (RBT) Basics**
A **Red-Black Tree** is a **self-balancing binary search tree (BST)** with the following properties:

### **RBT Rules:**
1. **Node Color**: Every node is either **RED** or **BLACK**.
2. **Root Property**: The root is always **BLACK**.
3. **Red Property**: No two adjacent (parent-child) nodes can be **RED**.
4. **Black Depth**: Every path from a node to its descendant `null` leaves must have the **same number of BLACK nodes** (ensures balance).
5. **Leaf Nodes**: All `null` leaves (NIL nodes) are considered **BLACK**.

### **Why Red-Black Tree?**
- Ensures the tree remains **balanced**, preventing worst-case O(n) operations (unlike an unbalanced BST).
- Guarantees **O(log n)** time complexity for insertion, deletion, and search.

---

## **2. How `TreeMap` Works Internally?**
### **A. Node Structure**
Each `TreeMap` entry is stored as a `TreeMap.Entry<K,V>` node with:
- **Key** (K) and **Value** (V)
- **Left Child** (pointer to left subtree)
- **Right Child** (pointer to right subtree)
- **Parent** (pointer to parent node)
- **Color** (RED or BLACK)

### **B. Insertion (`put()`)**
1. **BST Insertion**:  
   - The new node is inserted like in a **Binary Search Tree (BST)**.
   - By default, it is colored **RED** (to minimize violations).

2. **Fix RBT Violations**:  
   - If the parent is **RED**, check **uncle (parent‚Äôs sibling)**:
     - **Case 1: Uncle is RED**  
       ‚Üí Recolor parent, uncle, and grandparent.  
     - **Case 2: Uncle is BLACK (or null)**  
       ‚Üí Perform **rotations (left/right)** and recolor to balance the tree.

### **C. Deletion (`remove()`)**
1. **BST Deletion**:  
   - Remove the node like in a BST.
   - If the deleted node was **BLACK**, the tree may become unbalanced.

2. **Fix RBT Violations**:  
   - **Case 1: Sibling is RED**  
     ‚Üí Rotate and recolor.  
   - **Case 2: Sibling is BLACK with BLACK children**  
     ‚Üí Recolor sibling and propagate the fix upward.  
   - **Case 3: Sibling is BLACK with at least one RED child**  
     ‚Üí Rotate and recolor to restore balance.

### **D. Search (`get()`)**
- Uses **BST search** (O(log n)) since the tree is always balanced.

## **3. Example: Insertion in `TreeMap`**
### **Step-by-Step Insertion (5, 3, 7, 2, 4, 6, 8)**
1. **Insert 5 (Root)**  
   - Root is **BLACK**.
   ```
     5(B)
   ```

2. **Insert 3**  
   - 3 is **RED** (left child of 5).
   ```
       5(B)
      /
    3(R)
   ```

3. **Insert 7**  
   - 7 is **RED** (right child of 5).  
   - No violations (parent is BLACK).
   ```
       5(B)
      /   \
    3(R)  7(R)
   ```

4. **Insert 2**  
   - 2 is **RED** (left child of 3).  
   - Parent (3) is RED, uncle (7) is RED ‚Üí **Recolor** (3 & 7 ‚Üí BLACK, 5 ‚Üí RED).
   ```
       5(R)
      /   \
    3(B)  7(B)
    /
  2(R)
   ```

5. **Insert 4**  
   - 4 is **RED** (right child of 3).  
   - Parent (3) is BLACK ‚Üí No violation.
   ```
       5(R)
      /   \
    3(B)  7(B)
    / \
  2(R)4(R)
   ```

6. **Insert 6**  
   - 6 is **RED** (left child of 7).  
   - Parent (7) is BLACK ‚Üí No violation.
   ```
       5(R)
      /   \
    3(B)  7(B)
    / \   /
  2(R)4(R)6(R)
   ```

7. **Insert 8**  
   - 8 is **RED** (right child of 7).  
   - Parent (7) is RED, uncle (3) is BLACK ‚Üí **Left Rotation** on 5.
   ```
       7(B)
      /   \
    5(R)  8(R)
    / \
  3(B)6(B)
  / \
2(R)4(R)
   ```

## **4. Performance & Use Cases**
| Operation | Time Complexity | Notes |
|-----------|----------------|-------|
| `put()`   | O(log n) | Rebalancing may occur |
| `get()`   | O(log n) | Binary search |
| `remove()`| O(log n) | Rebalancing may occur |
| `firstKey()`/`lastKey()` | O(log n) | Traversal to leftmost/rightmost node |
| `subMap()` | O(log n + k) | k = number of elements in range |

### **When to Use `TreeMap`?**
‚úÖ **Sorted keys** (e.g., leaderboard, dictionary).  
‚úÖ **Range queries** (e.g., "find keys between 10 and 20").  
‚úÖ **Custom ordering** (via `Comparator`).  

‚ùå **Avoid when:**  
   - **Order doesn‚Äôt matter** (use `HashMap` for O(1) operations).  
   - **High-frequency inserts/deletes** (rebalancing overhead).  

---

## **5. Thread Safety & Alternatives**
- **`TreeMap` is not thread-safe** ‚Üí Use `Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(new TreeMap<>())` or `ConcurrentSkipListMap` (lock-free alternative).  
- **`ConcurrentSkipListMap`** is better for **highly concurrent** sorted maps.

---

## **Conclusion**
- `TreeMap` uses a **Red-Black Tree** for **sorted key storage**.
- Guarantees **O(log n)** operations due to **self-balancing**.
- Supports **range queries** (`subMap`, `headMap`, `tailMap`).
- **Not thread-safe** ‚Üí Prefer `ConcurrentSkipListMap` for concurrent scenarios.

************


The `TreeMap` in Java is a sophisticated data structure that maintains its key-value pairs in a sorted order. To achieve this, it relies on a specific type of self-balancing binary search tree: the red-black tree. Here's a breakdown of its internal workings:

**1. Red-Black Tree:**

* **Structure:**
    * The core of `TreeMap` is a red-black tree. This is a binary search tree with an added "color" attribute for each node (either red or black).
    * This coloring, along with specific rules, ensures that the tree remains balanced, preventing it from becoming excessively skewed, which would degrade performance.
* **Balancing:**
    * The red-black tree maintains balance through rotations and color changes during insertions and deletions.
    * These operations ensure that the height of the tree remains logarithmic, guaranteeing O(log n) time complexity for basic operations.
* **Properties:**
    * Red-black trees adhere to specific properties:
        * Each node is either red or black.
        * The root is black.
        * All leaves (null nodes) are black.
        * If a node is red, then both its children are black.
        * Every path from a given node to any of its descendant null nodes contains the same number of black nodes.

**2. Sorting:**

* **Ordering:**
    * `TreeMap` keeps its keys sorted. This can be based on:
        * The natural ordering of the keys (if they implement the `Comparable` interface).
        * A custom `Comparator` provided during `TreeMap` creation.
* **Binary Search Tree Property:**
    * The binary search tree property is crucial:
        * For any node, all keys in its left subtree are less than the node's key.
        * All keys in its right subtree are greater than the node's key.
    * This property, combined with the red-black tree's balancing, enables efficient searching.

**3. Operations:**

* **Insertion (`put()`):**
    * When a new key-value pair is inserted, the `TreeMap` finds the correct position for the new node based on the key's ordering.
    * Then, it inserts the node and performs necessary rotations and color changes to maintain the red-black tree's properties.
* **Retrieval (`get()`):**
    * To retrieve a value, the `TreeMap` traverses the tree, comparing keys to find the desired node.
    * Due to the tree's structure, this is an efficient O(log n) operation.
* **Deletion (`remove()`):**
    * Deleting a node involves finding the node and then adjusting the tree to maintain its red-black tree properties.
    * This also includes rotation and color changes.
* **Iteration:**
    * Because of the nature of the binary tree, in order traversal of the tree, provides the keys in a sorted order.

**In essence:**

* `TreeMap` uses a red-black tree to store its data.
* This ensures that the data is always sorted and that operations are performed efficiently.
* The red-black tree's self-balancing properties are critical for maintaining performance.

Great question! Understanding the **internal working of `TreeMap`** in Java gives you deeper insight into how it maintains **sorted order** and ensures **efficient performance**.

### üå≥ **Core Idea: TreeMap uses a Red-Black Tree**

`TreeMap` is based on a **Red-Black Tree**, which is a self-balancing **binary search tree (BST)**. The keys are stored in this tree structure, which ensures:
- **Sorted order of keys** (based on natural order or a provided `Comparator`)
- **O(log n)** time complexity for operations like `put()`, `get()`, `remove()`

---

### üîÑ Red-Black Tree Properties
A **Red-Black Tree** maintains balance by following these rules:
1. Each node is either **red** or **black**.
2. The **root** is always black.
3. No two **consecutive red** nodes (i.e., red node cannot have a red child).
4. Every path from a node to a descendant leaf has the same number of **black nodes**.
5. It **rebalances itself** on insert and delete operations via **rotations** and **color flips**.

These rules help maintain a **balanced tree**, avoiding the worst-case time complexity of a regular BST (`O(n)`).

---

### üß™ Internal Data Structure
Internally, `TreeMap` stores entries as instances of a private static class:
```java
static final class Entry<K,V> implements Map.Entry<K,V> {
    K key;
    V value;
    Entry<K,V> left;
    Entry<K,V> right;
    Entry<K,V> parent;
    boolean color; // true = RED, false = BLACK
}
```

Each `Entry` is a node in the Red-Black Tree.

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è Operations

#### ‚ûï `put(K key, V value)`
1. **Traverse** the tree using `compareTo()` or a provided `Comparator`.
2. Insert the new node like in a binary search tree.
3. Perform **coloring and rotations** to maintain red-black properties.

#### üîç `get(Object key)`
1. Start from the root.
2. Use `compareTo()` to navigate left or right.
3. Returns the node‚Äôs value if found.

#### ‚ùå `remove(Object key)`
1. Locate the node.
2. Use Red-Black Tree deletion rules.
3. Rebalance using **color adjustments** and **rotations**.

---

### üß† Comparator vs Comparable
- If no `Comparator` is provided, keys must implement `Comparable<K>`.
- If a `Comparator` is provided at construction, it's used for **all key comparisons**.

```java
TreeMap<String, Integer> naturalOrder = new TreeMap<>();
TreeMap<String, Integer> customOrder = new TreeMap<>((a, b) -> b.compareTo(a)); // reverse order
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Notes & Edge Cases
- **Null keys are not allowed**: `TreeMap` needs to compare keys, and `null` can't be compared.
- Values can be `null`, but keys must be non-null.
- Insertion of duplicate keys will **replace the value** but not create a new node.
